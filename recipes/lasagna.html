                    <ul> <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your lasagna recipe (usually around 375°F or 190°C).</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Cook lasagna sheets:</strong>
                <ul><li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Add a bit of salt and oil to the boiling 
                water to prevent sticking. Once cooked, drain and lay the noodles flat on a clean surface.</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Cook The Sauce:</strong>
                <ul><li>In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground meat over medium heat until browned. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, 
                        cooking until the onions are softened. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, herbs, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 
                        15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Remove from heat and set aside.</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong>
                <ul><li>In a bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, salt, pepper, and any additional herbs 
                    or spices you prefer.</li></ul>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong>
                <ul><li>Lightly grease a baking dish with olive oil. Spread a small amount of meat sauce at the bottom. Place a layer of cooked 
                        lasagna noodles over the sauce. Add a layer of the meat sauce, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers 
                        until you run out of ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Bake it:</strong>
                <ul><li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an 
                    additional 10-15 minutes or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li></ul>
