    <h3>Burger Final Product</h3>
    <p>A burger is a sandwich consisting of a seasoned and cooked ground meat patty, typically beef, placed inside a sliced
    bun. It is commonly garnished with various condiments, vegetables, and cheese.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground meat</li>
        <li>Burger buns</li>
        <li>Condiments</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Meat:</strong>
            <ul><li>Start by shaping the ground beef into patties. Season each patty with salt and pepper on both sides. 
                You can make the patties according to your preferred size and thickness.</li></ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Preheat the Grill:</strong>
            <ul><li>Preheat your grill or a frying pan over medium-high heat. If using a grill, make sure it's clean and 
                well-oiled to prevent sticking.</li></ul></li>

        <li><strong>Cook the patties:</strong>
            <ul><li>Cook the burger patties on the preheated grill or pan. For medium-rare to medium burgers, cook for 
                about 4-5 minutes per side. Adjust the cooking time based on your desired level of doneness.</li></ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Add Cheese:</strong>
            <ul><li>If you want cheese on your burgers, add a slice of cheese to each patty during the last minute of 
                cooking. This allows the cheese to melt.</li></ul></li>

        <li><strong>Assemble Burger:</strong>
            <ul><li>Once the patties are cooked to your liking, assemble the burgers. Place a cooked patty on the bottom 
                half of a bun. Add condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise), cheese (if used), and vegetables. Top with 
                the other half of the bun.</li></ul></li>
    </ol>
